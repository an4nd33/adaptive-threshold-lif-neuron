# Analysis Plan

## Power Analysis
1. Simulate baseline LIF neuron
2. Simulate adaptive-threshold LIF neuron
3. Measure supply current
4. Compute average power over identical time window

## Area Analysis
1. Compare transistor count
2. Compare additional passive components
3. Document overhead qualitatively

## Outcome
Demonstrate reduction in average power due to spike-frequency adaptation.
